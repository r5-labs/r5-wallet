# Security Clarifications

## Key Concepts

* **Self-Custody**: Users maintain full control and ownership of their private keys. The application never transmits, stores, or shares private keys with any third party.
* **Local Storage**: Data is stored securely on the user's device. No information is sent to external cloud storage unless explicitly done by the user.
* **Encryption**: Sensitive data, including private keys, is encrypted using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms. Decryption requires a password or key known only to the user.

## How Private Keys are Handled

1) Private keys are never stored in plain text on the device.

2) When a new wallet is created, the private key is encrypted using a key derived from the user's password (e.g., via PBKDF2, scrypt, or Argon2).

3) The encrypted key file is securely saved in the device's local storage.

4) When the user opens the wallet and enters their password, the application attempts to decrypt the key file to verify access. If decryption fails, access is denied.

5) During transactions or operations requiring signing, the private key is decrypted in memory using the user’s password and never written to disk in unencrypted form.

6) Decrypted private keys are purged from memory immediately after use.
   
### ⚠️ Important

* **Password strength is critical.** Weak passwords are vulnerable to brute-force attacks. We strongly recommend a long, complex password, ideally generated by a password manager.
* The application allows users to export or view their private keys. Doing so increases the risk of exposure to malware or interception.
  * If you must view or export your key, we highly **recommend enabling airplane mode or disconnecting your device from all networks**.
* Avoid storing private keys in other apps (e.g., Notes, cloud backups). Use offline or air-gapped storage solutions when necessary.

## App Security Architecture

1) The app uses encrypted local storage with file system access permissions restricted to the application sandbox.

2) No private key data is sent to external servers.

3) All network communications are performed over HTTPS with certificate validation.

4) The app includes anti-debugging and tamper detection where possible (implementation may vary by platform).

## RPC Security

The pre-built versions available to download via the releases page uses R5 Labs' public RPCs for network queries. You can opt to use your own node for enhanced security, and you can do that by changing the parameters under `/src/constants` and buildind your own binaries.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We incentivize responsible disclosure of bugs and vulnerabilities through our [**Bug Bounty Program**](https://docs.r5.network/bug-bounty-program).

If you find a vulnerability in this application, you can responsibly disclose it to the developers via the Bug Bounty form, email, or on a private conversation on social media.
